# Moneyball Problem

This problem is part of the Udemy Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp with R.
The goal is to find the optimal replacements for the three batters who left the Oakland Athletics in 2001.

The following statistics were to be considered to find the best rio: Combined salary, combined bats, and average on base percentage.

In my solution I first visualize all reasonably good trios and then pick the one that appears the best to me.

IMO, the best solution at Salary = 10,088,333, At Base =	1773, and OBP = .430 is:
--> berkmla01,	gonzalu01,	heltoto01
